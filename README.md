# Getting Started with Python Text

1. Use `cd ~` to get to your root directory.
1. Make a new directory called `unit 5`.
1. `cd` into that directory
1. Make a new file called `first.py`.
1. Open that file.
1. Grab one of the packets called "Packet: Getting Started with Python".
1. Work on that packet, writing code in your `first.py` file.
1. Run the python code by typing this in the terminal: `python first.py`
1. When the packet tells you to write code in "the interpreter", go to the command line and just type `python`. This will give you a `>>>` prompt, which is the python interpreter. Here you can type single lines of code and python will run them as soon as you press enter.
1. How to get out of the interpreter, when you want to go back to the regular command line `$` prompt? Hmmm... I could tell you but that would rob you of the chance to google it and find out yourself.
1. When you're done with the packet, check your answers against the provided solutions.
1. Then go back to google classroom, open up the assignment questions, and copy/paste a screenshot of the code you wrote for this assignment.
1. Then answer the rest of the assignment questions and press 'Turn in'.
